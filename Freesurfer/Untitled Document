Mesh Extraction from freesurfer can be viewed as either partial or complete extraction ? 


I will talk about 2 methods for mesh extraction, one brainder, the other is my method.
The general yiest of mesh extraction is to obtain a surface file in Freesurfer.
Thus we will briefly look at different types of files in Freesurfer.

-	.mgh or .mgz , .mgh is a volume file and is pixel based.


-       curvature


-       TIFF 



-Inflated ?

Brainder script can easily be dowloaded, and works as follows. Given a volume with labels, select the label or lables
to be extracted then 

The method is simple and do not involve many commands. But likewise it is not very high resolution to the mesh.


Therefore I look at other methods, and basically I looked at surfaces genereated by Freesurfer.

By looking at the ? pial ? we can see a very high resolution image.

Therefore I wanted to obtain extract this surface file



For this I saw some of the commmands 


Problem, this method only gives the rigtht or left hemisphere/white matter. 

So whats the difference between Brainder and this method.





To obtain the mesh. Both ways are based on the commmand

mris_convert 

which transform a binary surface file to that of a asc.  This type a file can easily be read with as plain text __> seee

However the format of this file is not implemented in Fenics mesh construction. ( yet)?


Therefore we need to transform the file to a known implemented format. For MSHR these are Tentgen , off and stl.


I wrote a set of scripts git - surface2mesh 
 
And I will now talk about these scripts

- Freesurfer general introduction
	- Hi 

	- I will today talk about mesh extraction from freesurfer, but first I will shortly talk about Freesurfer.

	  Setting Freesurfer upp:
		step 1 install
		step 2 set upp enviorment
			- I chose to set the enviorment upp in tcsh (turbo c shell ). This way it is seperate from
			  my bash enviroment variabels.
		step 3 test?
